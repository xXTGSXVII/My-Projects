A chip on your shoulder
A dime a dozen
A fool and his money are soon parted
A piece of cake
An arm and a leg
Back to square one
Barking up the wrong tree
Beating around the bush
Between a rock and a hard place
Burst Your Bubble
Calm before the storm
Cat got your tongue
Cry over spilled milk
Cup of joe
Cut to the chase
Call it a day
Easier said than done
Jump to conclusions
Knock it out of the park
Learn the ropes
Long in the tooth
Music to my ears
Making a mountain out of a molehill
On cloud nine
Slow and steady wins the race
